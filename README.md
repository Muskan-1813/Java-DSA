## 🌱 Java + DSA From Scratch

Welcome to my **Java & Data Structures and Algorithms** learning repository!  
I’m starting my journey **from the very basics** — learning programming concepts step by step before diving into DSA.

### 📘 Learning Stages

#### 🩵 Stage 1: Programming Basics (Java Fundamentals)
- [ ] Introduction to Programming  
- [ ] Flowcharts & Pseudocode  
- [ ] Variables & Data Types  
- [ ] Input / Output in Java  
- [ ] Operators & Expressions  
- [ ] Conditional Statements (`if`, `switch`)  
- [ ] Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- [ ] Functions / Methods  
- [ ] Arrays  
- [ ] Strings  

#### 💙 Stage 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP in Java)
- [ ] Classes & Objects  
- [ ] Constructors  
- [ ] Inheritance  
- [ ] Polymorphism  
- [ ] Encapsulation  
- [ ] Abstraction  

#### 💜 Stage 3: Data Structures
- [ ] Arrays (Revisited)  
- [ ] Linked List  
- [ ] Stack  
- [ ] Queue  
- [ ] Trees  
- [ ] Graphs  

#### 💛 Stage 4: Algorithms
- [ ] Searching Algorithms  
- [ ] Sorting Algorithms  
- [ ] Recursion  
- [ ] Dynamic Programming  
- [ ] Greedy Algorithms

### ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muskan-1813/Java-DSA.git


2.Open the project in your favorite IDE (IntelliJ, VS Code, or Eclipse).

3.Navigate to the folder you want to explore and run the .java file.

🧠 Goal

“Start small, stay consistent, and build strong fundamentals.”

This repo is my personal learning space — I’ll be adding code examples, notes, and practice problems as I progress.
